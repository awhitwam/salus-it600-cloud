# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-12

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Critical: AWS IoT credentials expiration**
  - Fixed issue where credentials expired after ~1 hour causing all control operations to fail
  - Error symptoms: "WebSocket handshake error, connection not upgraded" and MQTT rc=7 (not authorized)
  - Added `_aws_credentials_expiry` field to track credential expiration time
  - Parse expiration timestamp from AWS GetCredentialsForIdentity response
  - Automatically refresh credentials 5 minutes before expiration
  - Disconnect and reconnect MQTT client when credentials are refreshed
  - Improved error handling for MQTT disconnections during publish operations
  - Added retry logic for publish operations after reconnection

### Changed
- AWS IoT credentials now automatically renewed before expiration
- MQTT client properly disconnects before credential refresh
- Better connection state management (check both flag and actual connection)

### Technical Details
- Credentials from Cognito Identity Pool expire after ~1 hour
- `_ensure_mqtt_connected()` now checks expiration before every connection
- Fallback expiration: 1 hour if timestamp not provided by AWS
- This ensures uninterrupted device control functionality 24/7

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed
- 🐛 **HVAC action state detection**
  - Fixed typo in `hvac_action` property causing incorrect state display
  - Changed `ep9:sIT600_TH:RunningState` to `ep9:sIT600TH:RunningState`
  - Now correctly shows "heating" or "idle" based on actual thermostat state
  - Running state attribute was showing correctly, but hvac_action wasn't
- 📝 **Logging improvements**
  - Changed all INFO logs to DEBUG level
  - Reduced log verbosity during normal operation
  - Only WARNING and ERROR messages shown by default
  - Debug information (API requests, MQTT operations, device states) now at DEBUG level
  - Applied to gateway.py, climate.py, config_flow.py, and button.py

### Changed
- Cleaner logs with less noise during normal operation
- Better log level classification (INFO → DEBUG for routine operations)

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed
- 🐛 **MQTT WebSocket connection to AWS IoT**
  - Fixed "WebSocket handshake error, connection not upgraded"
  - Added proper connection synchronization using `asyncio.Event`
  - Improved connection timeout handling (10 seconds)
  - Added connection result verification (rc code check)
  - Better TLS/SSL configuration with cert verification
- 🔧 **Device index detection**
  - Fixed hardcoded device index "11" issue
  - Device index now automatically detected from shadow data
  - Stored as `_shadow_device_index` during device initialization
  - Fallback to "11" if detection fails
- 📝 **Debug logging improvements**
  - Extensive MQTT operation logging
  - Device index information in logs
  - WebSocket URL details (first 100 chars)
  - Error tracebacks for better debugging
  - Proper log level mapping for paho-mqtt

### Changed
- Gateway functions now accept optional `device_index` parameter:
  - `set_temperature(device_code, temperature, device_index=None)`
  - `set_hold_mode(device_code, mode, device_index=None)`
  - `set_switch_state(device_code, state, device_index=None)`
- MQTT connection now waits for actual connection before proceeding
- Better error messages with more context

### Technical Details
- Added `_mqtt_connect_event` and `_mqtt_connect_rc` for connection tracking
- Improved `_ensure_mqtt_connected()` with proper async/sync coordination
- Enhanced `update_device_shadow()` with automatic device index discovery
- Better exception handling with full tracebacks

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from pre-1.0 (read-only) versions

**Entity ID Changes**:
Old versions used simple entity IDs like `climate.termostat_pokoj`.
Version 1.0+ uses gateway-specific IDs like `climate.apartman_245_5_termostat_pokoj`.

**Steps**:
1. Note down your current entity IDs
2. Update the integration
3. Remove and re-add the integration
4. Update automations and scripts with new entity IDs

**Unique ID Format**:
- Old: `salus_it600_cloud_{device_id}`
- New: `salus_it600_cloud_{gateway_id}_{device_id}`

This allows multiple gateways without conflicts.
